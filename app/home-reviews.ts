Kurt was the perfect hiking guide—knowledgeable, supportive, and encouraging. The hike turned out to be a bit more challenging than I expected, but Kurt’s expertise made all the difference. He not only knows the mountain inside and out, but he's also great at making you feel safe and confident. On top of that, he shared fascinating cultural tidbits about the area, which made the experience even more special. The challenge only added to the enjoyment of the hike, and the extra insights made it unforgettable.",
