      "Tauriq is extremely knowledgeable about the area and is a very experienced hiker. We did his Lion's Head sunset hike and it was incredible. The views are unmatched. We also learned a lot about the history of Cape Town. You will not regret your experience with Tauriq!",

      "I had the pleasure of doing a 2 day fast pack and sleep over in the Cederberg mountain range with Tauriq. Our hike commenced on a Friday evening with us sleeping over in a cave ie Spout cave on night 1. We were fully prepared for the sleep over, with equipment and nourishment requirements planned and prepped weeks in advance. Tauriq was meticulous in his planning and all members of the fast packing group were comfortable and at ease at all times. He was easy going and lovely to talk to with exceptional knowledge of the mountains, flora, fauna and the birdlife too. We felt safe and relaxed at all times and he was stern when he needed to be to keep the group together and focused when challenges arose in our environment or within the group.\n Great value for money for this unique experience. I highly recommend him without reservation as he is an expert in his field.",
